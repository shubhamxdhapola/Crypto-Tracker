Introduction
This is a Python-based ATM simulator that allows users to perform various banking operations, including checking their balance, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money to other accounts, and viewing their transaction history. The simulator provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the ATM.

Features
User Authentication
The ATM simulator authenticates users by verifying their user ID and PIN. If the entered credentials match the stored values, the user is granted access to the ATM menu.

ATM Menu
The ATM menu provides the following options:

Check Balance: Displays the user's current account balance.
Deposit: Allows users to deposit funds into their account.
Withdraw: Enables users to withdraw funds from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.
Transfer: Facilitates fund transfers to other accounts, subject to sufficient balance.
Transaction History: Displays a record of all transactions performed by the user.
Quit: Exits the ATM simulator.
Transaction History
The transaction history feature maintains a record of all transactions performed by the user, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. This history is displayed in a clear and concise format.

Error Handling
The ATM simulator includes robust error handling to ensure that any exceptions or errors that occur during execution are caught and displayed to the user.

Implementation
The ATM simulator is implemented using Python classes and objects. The ATM class represents an ATM object, which is instantiated with a user ID, PIN, initial balance, and transaction history. The class provides methods for authenticating users, displaying the menu, performing transactions, and displaying the transaction history.

The main function is the entry point of the simulator, which creates an ATM object for the user, authenticates the user, and then enters a loop to display the menu and handle user choices.

Usage
To use the ATM simulator, simply run the atm_simulator.py script. You will be prompted to enter your user ID and PIN. Once authenticated, you can interact with the ATM menu to perform various banking operations.

Note: This is a basic simulator and does not store user data persistently. All data is lost when the simulator is exited.

Code Structure
The code is organized into a single file, atm_simulator.py, which contains the ATM class and the main function.

ATM Class
The ATM class is defined with the following attributes:

user_id: The user's ID
pin: The user's PIN
balance: The user's initial balance
transaction_history: A list of transactions performed by the user
The class provides the following methods:

authenticate_user: Authenticates the user by checking the entered user ID and PIN
display_menu: Displays the ATM menu
check_balance: Displays the user's current balance
deposit: Deposits funds into the user's account
withdraw: Withdraws funds from the user's account
transfer: Transfers funds to another account
display_transaction_history: Displays the user's transaction history
main Function
The main function is the entry point of the simulator, which:

Creates an ATM object for the user
Authenticates the user
Enters a loop to display the menu and handle user choices
